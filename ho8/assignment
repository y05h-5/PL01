Extend the project primes by adding functionality for printing all the checked values. 
For every checked value please also print all the checked divisors tried before getting 
final decision whether the checked value is prime or not.  
You are not requested to write the code producing producing completely the same output, 
but please create an output with all the required information.

Please upload two files:
    Your C module with the revised version of fillPrimes() function which prints the requested additional information.
    Your output text file with 20 first primes with all the requested additional information.
