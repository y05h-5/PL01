# Exercise 1

## Task:

**Problem**: area of a triangle defined by 3 vertexes  
**Input Data**: three pairs of floating-point values  
**Result**: print the triangle's area if the triangle with the given vertex may exist. otherwise, print the message explaning why a triangle could not be constructed  

**Notes**: check all input data for format correctness and pay attention to the fact that some vertices might be equal  

## Needs:

- x read input data from terminal
- x check the validity of the input
- x check the existence of the triangle
    - x if not, give the reasons
    - x possible cases:
        - x two or more vertices are equal = line or a point
        - x all points are aligned = line
        - 
- x calculate the area of the triangle
    - x calculate the sides?
    - x apply the formula
    - 
- x output the calculated result
